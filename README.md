# BART-BMA
An R-Rcpp implementation of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees using Bayesian Model Averaging for supervised learning. BART-BMA extends upon the BART algorithm of Chipman,George and McColloch [BART: Bayesian Additive Regressive Trees. The Annals of Applied Statistics. 
2010 4(1): 266-298](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1273584455) for use on high dimensional data. BART-BMA utilises a greedy search algorithm and an efficient implementation of Bayesian model averaging called Occam's window making it far more efficient than BART for high dimensional data.
